## My Data Projects

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! This respository contains examples of the work I have done with SQL and Tableau.

### ðŸ“Š Data Projects
- [KC 311 Requests](https://github.com/lsaute/Data-Portfolio/tree/main/KC%20311%20Requests) - For this project, I downloaded raw data from OpenDataKC. The original dataset contained service request data from the 311 call center in Kansas City, MO from 2006-2021. I cleaned and organized the data using Microsoft SQL Server and reduced the scope to only requests created in 2019-2020. I extracted the information in a .csv file and uploaded to Tableau Desktop where I created visualizations and a dashboard. I published the dashboard on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lacy.saute).
