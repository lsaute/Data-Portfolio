### Table of Contents
- [Employee Time Report](https://github.com/lsaute/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Visualizations/Employee%20Time%20Report.pdf) - For this visualization, I used my time report from the company I currently work for and removed any private information. I uploaded the .xlsx file to Tableau Desktop where I created visualizations and a dashboard. I published the dashboard to Tableau Public [here][Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lacy.saute/viz/EmployeeTimeReport/EmployeeTimeReport).
