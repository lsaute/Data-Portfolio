For this project, I downloaded raw data from [OpenDataKC](https://data.kcmo.org/311/311-Call-Center-Service-Requests-2007-March-2021/7at3-sxhp). This data set contained service request data from the 311 call center in Kansas City, MO from 2006-2021.
I cleaned and organized the data using Microsoft SQL Server and reduced the scope to only requests created in 2019-2020. I extracted the information in a .csv file and uploaded to Tableau Public where I created visualizations and a dashboard.
